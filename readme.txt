This plugin is designed to help 12 step programs list their meetings and locations. It standardizes addresses, and displays in a list or map.

== Description ==

This plugin was originally designed to maintain a list of AA meetings in Santa Clara County, CA. It's currently in use in that capacity at <http://aasanjose.org/meetings>.

It can be used, however, to list any type of 12 step program meeting, such as Al-Anon, OA, or NA.

Some notes:
* in the admin screen, it's best to use Chrome, because then the time field will be nicest
* Notes is for any non-standardized meeting info, such as Basement, or Building C
* Location should be a simple place-name, eg Queen of the Valley Hospital
* Address should only be address, no "Upstairs" or "Building C" or "Near 2nd Ave"
* You can fill in a very basic address and then when you tab away from that field you will see it try to standardize the address for you. it means you write "1000 trancas, napa" and it will come back with "1000 Trancas Street, Napa, CA 94558, USA"
